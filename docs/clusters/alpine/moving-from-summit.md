## Moving From Summit

There are some notable changes on Alpine from Summit:

- The main processor type has changed from Intel (on Summit) to AMD (on Alpine) which may have an impact on software. All software available on Summit should also be available on Alpine. Contact the RC helpdesk at <rc-help@colorado.edu> if you run into a software issue.
- There are no dedicated compile nodes on Alpine, instead users can start an `acompile` job which serves the same purpose. See the [Alpine Quick Start page](./quick-start.html) for more details.
