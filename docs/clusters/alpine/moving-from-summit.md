## Moving From Summit

There are some notable changes on Alpine from Summit: out main processor type has changed from Intel (on Summit) to AMD (on Alpine) which may have an impact on software. All software available on Summit should also be available on Alpine. Contact the RC helpdesk at <rc-help@colorado.edu> if you run into a software issue.
