Alpine
===============

On May 18, 2022, CU Research Computing released phase 1 of Alpine, the third generation CURC High Performance 
Computing Cluster. Phase 2 was released in September 2022. The warranty of the Summit cluster's storage ended on 
September 30, 2022. The full sun-setting of the Summit system is yet to be finalized.

**Overview:**

Alpine is the University of Colorado Boulder Research Computingâ€™s third-generation high performance computing (HPC) cluster. Alpine is a heterogeneous compute cluster currently composed of hardware provided from University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado State University, and Anschutz Medical Campus. Alpine currently offers 317 compute nodes and a total of 18,080 cores.

Alpine can be securely accessed anywhere, anytime using OpenOnDemand or ssh connectivity to the CURC system.

**Nodes and Hardware Summary:**

Total Core Count: **18,080**

The Alpine cluster is made up of different types of nodes outlined below:

CPU nodes: 188 AMD Milan Compute nodes (184 nodes with 64 cores/node, 4 nodes with 48 cores/node) with 256 GB RAM
GPU nodes:
8 GPU-enabled (3x AMD MI100) atop AMD Milan CPU
8 GPU-enabled (3x NVIDIA A100) atop AMD Milan CPU
High-memory nodes: 12 AMD Milan nodes with 1TB of memory
Alpine also includes nodes contributed by partner institutions. Contributors with nodes in either deployment or production are:

Colorado State University: 77 AMD Milan compute nodes (28 nodes with 48 cores/node, 49 nodes with 32 cores/node)
CU Anschutz Medical Campus: 16 AMD Milan compute nodes (64 cores/node), 2 AMD Milan nodes with 1TB of RAM, and 4 GPU-enabled (3x NVIDIA A100 atop AMD Milan)

All nodes are available to all users. For full details about node access, please refer to the Alpine Node Access and FairShare policy.
