**Overview:**

Alpine is the University of Colorado Boulder Research Computing's third-generation high performance computing (HPC) cluster. Alpine is a heterogeneous compute cluster currently composed of hardware provided from University of Colorado Boulder. Additional contributions provided from Colorado State University and Anschutz Medical Campus are planned for the near future. Alpine currently offers 80 compute nodes and a total of 5120 cores.

Alpine can be securely accessed anywhere, anytime using OpenOnDemand or ssh connectivity to the CURC system.

**Hardware Summary:**

Total Core Count: **5120**

Nodes: The Alpine cluster is made up of different types of nodes outlined below.

* **CPU nodes:**
 * 64 AMD Milan Compute nodes (64 cores/node)

* **GPU nodes:**
 * 8 GPU-enabled (3x AMD MI100) atop AMD Milan CPU
 * 8 GPU-enabled (3x NVIDIA A100) atop AMD Milan CPU
