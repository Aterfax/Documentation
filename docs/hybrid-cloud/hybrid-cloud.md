## CURC Hybrid Cloud

The University of Colorado Research Computing hybrid-cloud supports computing, data, and science gateway needs that may not be good fits for the existing high-performance and high-throughput computing infrastructure provided to campus and regional research groups.

The hybrid-cloud system is composed of two cloud instances: 
- CUmulus: CURC's on-premise "Infrastructure as a Service" (IaaS) cloud platform based on OpenStack. 
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) for public cloud services.

These services can be managed multicloud management platform Mist.
