# Azure - Billing

## Document Purpose

This document describes the billing process for Azure subscriptions and  the steps to be followed when checking the Azure subscription billing.

## Billing Process
Azure billing is handled using SpeedType numbers. We support the following payment splitting methods:
* One speedtype pays everything
* Two or more speedtypes split the bill along percentages
* Two or more speedtypes pay sequentially, with each paying up to a maximum amount before moving on to the next
* Any mixed combination of the above (see complex example below)

Speedtypes will be charged during the next FBO bill processing cycle. Please email [rc-help@colorado.edu](mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu) with any billing disputes. 
Billing details can be viewed in the emailed invoice and Azure billing portal.
