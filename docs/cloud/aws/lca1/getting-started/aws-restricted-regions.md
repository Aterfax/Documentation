# AWS Restricted Regions
Access to AWS Regions is limited to the default regions documented here:
[see 'Regions disabled by default' subsection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/prereq-choose-region.html).

If you are classified as a Confidential or above, you will be restricted to US-Only regions.
If your confidential workload requires access to a Non-US region,
submit a request to <rc-help@colorado.edu> and we can help evaluate the feasibility.

If you are restricted to US-Only regions, you will see the Non-US regions in the AWS Console to select.
However, you will get API errors trying to use any Non-US regions.
