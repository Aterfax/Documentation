## Accounting

## Best Practices
- Ensure that your compute jobs perform output to your /scratch/summit or /rc_scratch (for Blanca) directories only.  Users whose jobs perform excessive I/O to /home or /projects may have their jobs killed and their accounts temporarily disabled.
- Store frequently used input data on /projects
